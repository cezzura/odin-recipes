    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Racuchy are Polish pancakes that are super popular as a dessert in Poland, but I make them for breakfast here for my kids. Serve sprinkled with powdered sugar or topped with sour cream.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups milk</li>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>Â½ teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt</li>
        <li>2 large apples - peeled, cored, and diced</li>
        <li>vegetable oil, or as needed, divided</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons confectioners' sugar, or to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Combine milk, flour, eggs, sugar, cinnamon, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer until smooth and creamy. Mix in apples.</li>
